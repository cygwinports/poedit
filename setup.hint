sdesc: "GUI gettext catalogs editor"
ldesc: "poEdit is cross-platform gettext catalogs (.po files) editor. It is
built with wxWidgets toolkit and can run on any platform supported by it
(although it was only tested on Unix with GTK+ and Windows). It aims to
provide more convenient approach to editing catalogs than launching vi
and editing the file by hand."
